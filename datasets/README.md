# Datasets

This folder contains the datasets that we are going to use for the project.

## Sinewave

5 sine waves with different frequencies are generated. The response variable is then computed as a random linear combination of these covariates. Gaussian random noise is added to the covariates.

## MNIST

The MNIST dataset is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each image is 28x28 pixels.
