# Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used for two main purposes:
- Defining the mutation operator for the activation function
- Comparing the performance of the genetic algorithm with the standard bayesian optimization


## GA vs BO

The notebooks `Results DATASET MLP.ipynb` contain the results of the comparison between the genetic algorithm and the bayesian optimization for the dataset DATASET and the MLP model.
